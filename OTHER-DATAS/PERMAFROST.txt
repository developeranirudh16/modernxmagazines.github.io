WHAT IS A PERMAFROST
Permafrost, despite its name, is not always frozen. Soil composition,the presence of salt,
and other factors can keep some of the ground from actually freezing, even as the temper-
ature remains below the freeazing point.
Across much of Alaska,Canada,Russia, and Antarctica, the ground is in fact frozen year-round
,however, to depths of as much as 5,000 feet. A relatively thin active layer near the top may
 be subject to a yearly freeze-thaw cycle,allowing ground vegetation to survive.
As the planet warms,the effect of meltdown in permafrost areas is a subject of debate.Some have
 speculated, for example, that a widespread thraw would release massive amounts of greenhouse 
gases now trapped in the permafrost into the atmosphere,further warming the planet
