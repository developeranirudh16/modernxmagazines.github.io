SEA OTTERS AND THEIR TOOLS

One of the smallest sea mammals,the sea otter has mastered the shallow coastal waters of the northern Pacafic Ocean.
It lives most of its life in the water,where it feeds on sea urchins,,abalone,mussels,clams,crabs,snails,fish,octop-
us,and other sea creatures.
The sea otter belongs to an exclusive club of tool-users that includes only a small number of animal species such as 
primates,elephants,and some birds.Diving more than 300 feets to obtain food,the sea otter may bring a clam or other  
mollusk to the surface along with a rock.Floating on its back,it rests the rock on its chest and repeatedly bangs the
clam against the rock until it opens.After the meal,the sea otter will roll over to wash bits of shell and food of 
its fur.
Mothers raise their young totally offshore .A mother's body serves as a bed,playpen,dining room,and diving platform 
for the young pup as it learns the ways of the ocean.To keep her young from floating away,a mother will wrap kelp 
around herself and her pup
